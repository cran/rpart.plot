The dataset was compiled by Frank Harrell and Robert Dawson:\cr
\url{http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic.html}.

For this version of the Titanic data, passenger details were deleted,
\code{survived} was cast as a \code{factor},
and the name changed to \code{ptitanic} to minimize confusion with
other versions.

In this data the crew are conspicuous by their absence.

How \code{ptitanic} was built:
    \preformatted{
    load("titanic3.sav") # from Dr. Harrell's web site
    # discard name, ticket, fare, cabin, embarked, body, home.dest
    ptitanic <- titanic3[,c(1,2,4,5,6,7)]
    # change survived from integer to factor
    ptitanic$survived <- factor(ptitanic$survived, labels = c("died", "survived"))
    save(ptitanic, file = "ptitanic.rda")}
This version of the data differs from
\code{\link[earth]{etitanic}} in the \code{\link[earth]{earth}} package
in that here \code{survived} is a factor (not an integer)
and \code{age} has some \code{NA}s.
